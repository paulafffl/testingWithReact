The purpose of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Db3tEF6pB8Am-IhCRgyGSxTalkDpUV" target="_blank">tutorial series</a> was to demonstrate how to properly implement a test first approach (TDD) to coding with react and redux. Within this series I learned how to test:

- Connected and unconnected components
 - Component state and Redux state
 - Action creators and reducers
 - Complex action creators that use Redux Thunk and Axios
 - Action creators called from connected components
